excerpt: "A simple lesson from nature, inspired by Jim Rohn, on why we should never place artificial limits on our own potential."

Have you ever asked a simple but profound question: How tall should a tree grow? The answer is beautifully simple. A tree should grow as tall as it possibly can.

This observation from nature holds one of the most powerful lessons about human potential. A tree never grows halfway and decides thatâ€™s far enough. It never stops reaching for more sun and driving its roots deeper for more nourishment. The tree isn't greedy. It is simply fulfilling its nature to become all it can be.

Why should we treat ourselves any differently? 

We often put limits on our own growth. We ask questions that build fences around our possibilities. But if we apply the wisdom of the tree, the answers become clear.

- How many books should you read? As many as you can.
- How much money should you make? As much as you can.
- How much should you share? As much as you possibly can.
- How hard should you try? As hard as you possibly can.

The point isn't to hoard money or knowledge. The goal is to see what you are capable of becoming. The act of reaching for your full potential transforms you. When you develop the capacity to earn more, you gain the capacity to give more. When you learn more, you have more wisdom to offer the world.

Life is not about being "good enough." It is about being all you can be. And just like a tree, we must accept that challenges will come. The storms will rage and the seasons will turn. Some years, the conditions will be perfect. In other years, hail might strike just before the harvest. That is the nature of this planet.

But the tree's job remains the same. And so does yours.

So the next time you wonder how far you should go, look at a tree. Stop building your own ceilings. Start reaching.
