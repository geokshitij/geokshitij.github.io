excerpt: "Life isn't a straight line; it's a cycle of seasons. As Jim Rohn taught, understanding whether you're in a time of planting, protecting, harvesting, or surviving is the key to everything."

The great philosopher Jim Rohn taught a simple but profound metaphor: life unfolds in seasons, just like a year. There are winters of hardship, springs of opportunity, summers of effort, and autumns of harvest. 

The seasons don't ask for permission. They just arrive. You cannot change the seasons, but you *can* change yourself. The secret to a successful life is to learn how to handle all four. 

### 1. Spring: The Season to Sow

> *The law of sowing and reaping is clear: you must plant the seed before you can have the harvest.*

Spring is the season of opportunity. The ground is soft, the conditions are right. This is when you must act. This is the time to plant your seeds—start the new project, learn the new skill, make the call you’ve been putting off. 

It’s a brief window. If you spend your spring waiting for the perfect moment or for motivation to strike, you will have nothing to tend in the summer and nothing to harvest in the fall. Don't be fooled by the ease of the season; the work of spring is urgent. Seize the opportunity.

### 2. Summer: The Season to Protect

> *"In summer, you must protect what you've planted."

Summer is the season of diligent, often unseen, effort. Your seeds have been planted, but now the weeds and pests will show up. These are the inevitable challenges: distractions, negativity (from others and yourself), and setbacks. 

This is the hard part. It requires discipline to pull the weeds and fend off the pests every single day. The growth is happening underground, in the root system, where it isn't always visible. It's easy to get discouraged in summer, to think your efforts aren't paying off. But this is the season where strength is built. You must protect what you’ve started, or there will be nothing left for the harvest.

### 3. Autumn: The Season to Reap

> *In the fall, you receive the results—good or bad.*

Autumn is the season of results. It is the harvest, and it never lies. It reveals the exact consequences of your actions in the spring and summer. If you planted diligently and protected your crop, you will have a bounty. If you were lazy in the spring or negligent in the summer, your baskets will be light.

This is the season to take full responsibility. Celebrate your successes without arrogance, and accept your poor results without complaint. Autumn isn’t sentimental; it’s accurate. Use it to gather not just rewards, but also wisdom for the next cycle.

### 4. Winter: The Season to Survive and Grow Stronger

> *You must learn to handle all the winters of your life.*

Winter always comes. It is the season of hardship, loss, disappointment, and delay. The ground is frozen, and nothing appears to be growing. These are the times when you feel stuck or defeated. 

You cannot avoid winter. The only choice you have is how to use it. Don't wish for winter to be over; wish for yourself to be stronger. This is the time to build your character, to read, to study, to reflect on the lessons from your last harvest. It is a time for building deep roots so that when spring arrives again—and it always will—you are ready to act with more wisdom and strength than before.

### ...And Remember the Hailstorms

Sometimes, you do everything right. You plant in the spring, you protect your crop all summer, and then, right before the harvest, a hailstorm comes and wipes it all out.

Is it fair? No. But as Jim Rohn would say, "it’s just that kind of planet." Unpredictable things happen. The hailstorms are part of the deal. The true test of your character isn't whether you can prevent them—you can't—but whether you have the resilience to get up and be ready to plant again next spring.
