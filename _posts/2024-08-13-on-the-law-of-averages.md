excerpt: "How persistence and increasing your attempts can lead to success, even when you feel you're not an outlier."

Sometimes, we really want to stand out—become extraordinary or an outlier in whatever we do. But then reality hits, and we can’t even achieve what’s considered “average.” It can feel pretty brutal when you don’t get admitted to the school you wanted, or you apply to a hundred jobs and nobody ever replies. You email tons of professors and still end up with no response. It’s frustrating, I know.

This is where the Law of Averages can help us out. The idea is simple: if you keep trying enough times, something will eventually work out. It’s like if you send out a hundred job applications, there’s a higher chance that at least one will give you a shot. If you submit your paper to multiple journals, one of them might accept it. No matter how “bad” you think you are, if you keep pushing, your odds improve. You basically increase the probability of success by sheer persistence.

This reminds me of that saying: if you want something bad enough, the world somehow aligns to help you get it. It’s also kind of what the Bhagavad Gita teaches us: don’t worry so much about the end result, just focus on doing your work. Keep trying, keep pushing, and don’t overthink it. Eventually, something’s got to give. It’s a pretty good reminder!!
