excerpt: "We are taught to forgive others, but we often forget the one person who needs our compassion the most: ourselves. True forgiveness is an act of power, and it always starts from within."

We are told to forgive others for their mistakes. We are encouraged to let go of grudges and move on. But we often skip the first, most essential step in this entire process.

The first person you must forgive is yourself.

People forgive and forget what others have done, yet they carry the weight of their own past failures for a lifetime. They replay their mistakes, drowning in regret. But you cannot give what you do not have. If you cannot offer compassion to yourself for your own humanity, you will never be able to genuinely offer it to others.

### The Illusion of "Right" and "Wrong"

We get trapped because we believe in rigid ideas of 'right' and 'wrong.' We think people do wrong things to us, and we do wrong things ourselves. But often, people are just acting from their own stories, their own pain, or their own ignorance. These aren't universal truths; they are just taglines people live by.

When someone hurts you, it is rarely personal. It is a reflection of their own internal world. Your anger and resentment are the poison, but you are the one drinking it. You can be angry when you confirm the truth, you donâ€™t need to be angry at the beginning. Don't fall into the trap of letting their actions define your inner state. Forgive them, not necessarily for their sake, but to reclaim your own peace.

### Forgiveness is Not Weakness; It is Power

We are taught to think of forgiveness as a weakness, as if we are letting someone get away with something. This is a profound misunderstanding.

Holding a grudge is weakness. It means you are allowing someone else's actions from the past to control your emotions in the present. You are giving them free rent in your mind.

Forgiveness is the ultimate act of power. It is the declaration that you will no longer be a prisoner of the past. It is the choice to take your energy back and focus it on your own growth and peace.

This is a skill you can develop. Create a duality within yourself. Become the observer who can watch your own feelings of hurt or guilt without being consumed by them. From that place of clarity, you can offer yourself the same advice you would offer a friend. You would tell them to let it go. You would tell them they deserve peace.

Start there. Offer that same compassion to yourself. Only then will you have an infinite supply to give to the world.
