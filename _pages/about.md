Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate at Arizona State University, working at the intersection of data-driven hydrology, earth observation, and machine learning.

My journey into geoscience began during my undergraduate studies in Civil Engineering in Nepal, where I came face-to-face with the profound impact of natural hazards on communities. The world is experiencing unprecedented environmental stress—from devastating floods and droughts to catastrophic landslides. These events are not just statistics; they are reminders that our ability to anticipate and adapt is still limited. This realization ignited my passion: I don't want to just build tools that watch our planet struggle; I want to engineer solutions that help us build a more sustainable and resilient future.

My work is driven by the need to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and actionable, accessible solutions. To tackle this complex challenge, my research is built on three interconnected pillars:

### 1. Hydrometeorology and Hazard Science

At its core, my work is grounded in understanding the physical processes that drive environmental hazards. I focus on hydrometeorology—the intricate dance between water and the atmosphere that leads to events like rainfall-triggered landslides, floods, and droughts. I am particularly interested in the growing threat of compound and cascading disasters, where a chain of seemingly simple events combines to create a catastrophe. By modeling these complex interactions, we can move from reactive responses to proactive preparedness. A key part of this work involves creating frameworks that help identify and protect [critical infrastructure before disaster strikes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23789689.2023.2181552).

### 2. Harnessing Earth Observation

We live in an era of data abundance. Space agencies like NASA and ECMWF collectively archive hundreds of petabytes of Earth Observation (EO) data—an unbelievable treasure trove of information about our planet's health. However, this raw data is not the same as knowledge. My research focuses on transforming this deluge of satellite imagery and sensor readings into actionable intelligence. The goal is to develop scalable and generalizable methods that can assimilate this information to monitor land use change, assess water resources like [groundwater potential](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130417), and track hazard evolution in near real-time. By creating value from this data, we can provide decision-makers with a clearer, more current picture of our changing world.

### 3. Bridging the Gap with Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the critical bridge connecting vast EO datasets to complex real-world problems. These tools allow us to identify patterns and relationships that are too complex for traditional models to capture. My work involves engineering a suite of intelligent software and models designed for scalability and transferability. A central focus of my PhD is developing next-generation streamflow forecasting systems for arid regions like Arizona by assimilating satellite data. Instead of relying on fragmented, empirical models, I aim to build integrated systems that learn from diverse data sources to anticipate future conditions with greater accuracy.

Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to a future where scientific innovation directly supports sustainable development and community resilience. I believe in creating tools that are not only powerful but also accessible, enabling communities everywhere to better understand and navigate the environmental challenges they face. My work has been fortunate to be featured by national and international news media, and I am committed to continuing this journey of turning data into decisions and research into real-world impact.
