We are in the process of building a research group.

Our group will focus on addressing critical challenges at the intersection of water, climate, and society. We will leverage cutting-edge tools in **hydrological forecasting, natural hazards assessment, sustainable development, and artificial intelligence** to create actionable solutions for a resilient future.

Stay tuned for updates.
